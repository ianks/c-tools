C-Tools
=======

The goal of the repository is to build up some reusable data-structures, etc.
to be able to use in C development. Eventually, these will be used in bigger,
more ambitious goals (i.e. custom web servers, databases, and the like).

### Goals:
  1. Well-tested
  2. Portable
  3. Thread-safe whenever possible
  4. Highly readable
  5. Performant

#### Authors:
